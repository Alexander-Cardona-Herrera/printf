## **About the Project**

This project is carried out in order to test the knowledge acquired throughout the months spent at Holberton while seeking to contribute a little more knowledge and experience. In addition to this, develop soft skills in the area of   teamwork, collaborative synergy and problem solving along the way.

It was created looking simple and elegant but at the same time efficiency, following the framework and respecting what Holberton as a "final client" ask us to do.

The AirBnB clone project try to replicated the behavior of the website of the company AirBnB, witch needs to store lots of information from his users and his branch offices, and for this they are implementing json files, and a program to serializate and deserializates this information and store it properly.

## Flowchart

![Console Readme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77997865/124295490-83b34d80-db1e-11eb-880c-1e2ac7d6990f.jpg)

## How to install it

To use this AirBnB clone implementation you must clone the following repository on your local machine  <https://github.com/Jfprado11/AirBnB_clone.git>, once you has the repository on your machine you must give permissions of execution with the command `chmod u+x console.py`, and preferably use it in a version of `python 3`  

To make this AirBnB works you need to have in your machine the next files:

                console.py
                models > __init__.py
			 basemodel.py
			 user.py
			 amenity.py
			 city.py
			 place.py
			 state.py
			 review.py
			 engine > __init__.py
			          file_storage.py
                

Also in the same directory you can have the next files if you want to test it:
                
		 tests > __init__.py
		         test_models > __init__.py
			               test_basemodel.py
				       test_user.py
				       test_amenity.py
				       test_city.py
				       test_place.py
				       test_state.py
				       test_review.py
				       test_engine > __init__.py
				       		     test_file_storage.py

To run all tests please use the command `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
